## Background

Over the past year, we have witnessed long and arduous battles against record-breaking wildfires across the world.

Some of these fires burned thousands of acres of land and destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Additionally, smoke from the fire creates issues related to poor air quality, raising health concerns for people not just in the vicinity of the fire, but at distances hundreds of miles away.


## Causes

Major Causes:

* High temperature and dry climate
* Volcanic eruption
* Lightning
* Human Interference

## Case study: USA

Some human-caused fires result from campfires left unattended, the burning of debris, negligently discarded cigarettes and intentional acts of arson. The remaining 10 percent are started by lightning or lava. * According to Veriskâ€™s 2017 Wildfire Risk Analysis 4.5 million U.S. homes were identified at high or extreme risk of wildfire, with more than 2 million in California alone. Losses from wildfires added up to $5.1 billion over the past 10 years. * From January 1 to October 12, 2018, there were 49,658 wildfires in the U.S, compared to 51,126 wildfires in the same period in 2017, according to the National Inter-agency Fire Center. * About 8.1 million acres were burned in the 2018 period, compared with 8.6 million in 2017.


## Status quo

The time it takes to detect fires using satellite information is from 3-4 hours. So, NASA researchers are striving to reduce this time to 10 min or less.
Regular phone calls are not so informative and their veracity is often questioned, so we need a more trusted, informative (e.g live pics, videos, ...), and organized way to report wildfires.

Existing Tools : They are allowing people to be notified of wildfires in the news or those being fought by nearby firemen, but the user here is a passive party who can't contribute. So, the goal is to build a crowd-sourcing tool for citizens to contribute to early detection, verification, tracking, visualization, and notification of wildfires.


## Goal

Crowd-sourcing can support real-time detection and monitoring of natural disasters, including wildfires; improving environmental safety to preserve it from wildfire risk.

Images, videos, and people comments and reports can provide great help into building a wide picture of the problem for it to be properly contained; allowing people even thousands of miles away, and even those without televisions, to watch live pictures.


## Our Solution

* Report a Fire: take a real time image/video with an optional caption.
* User's report is verfied.
* Notify communities at risk: notify close-by residents and local fire departments.
* Track and visualize fires: users can view a map for the fires and its locations.

## Used Technologies & Techniques

* Android
* Firebase

* Machine Learning, Deep Learning : CNN, Transfer Learning


## Improvements & future work

Improving social media reach, by automated tweeting/posting of highly trusted reports to inform the news and general public.

Analyzing data and clustering reports to gain insights about common areas at high risk, and which areas need more or nearer firestations.

Integrate geo-spatial data from various sources to provide innovative services to citizens (e.g., local weather and local traffic)
