# Neighborhood-Map
* Develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit

***Description***

The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

- Include a list of Locations in New York city.

- The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. Heck, the icons even bounce like you expect them to.

- The information of locations are taken from the Foursquare API.

- The App is resposive for several screens (Pc and Mobiles).
